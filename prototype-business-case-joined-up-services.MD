# [Prototype] Business case to help join up government services

## Strategic Case

### Strategic Context

We aim to provide an initial case for investment to help Service Design and Technology standards deliver on the 2030 Vision for the DDaT function.

The vision says, "in 2030, government services will be joined up, trusted and responsive to user needs." GDS will help the DDaT function deliver on the promises in the vision. GDS Service Design and Technology Standards sets the bar for what good services look like. We want to provide better support for government to meet those standards.

This case for investment aims to compliment work on GOV.UK. We will make incremental changes to this prototype business case, informed by user research and data analysis.

### Strategic Objectives

Government is mostly unable to work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users. As a result, services are disjointed:

- Users are unable to do the thing they need to do with government without repetition or getting stuck
- Users cannot switch between channels without repetition

Disjointed services cost both government and the public. People are less productive, less happy, and less likely to trust government.

#### Cost of disjointed government

To solve these problems with services, government must be able to work work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users. We know they currently struggle to do this because:

- Senior Civil Servants are accountable for spending money on a specific thing, in an effective way that allows their organisation solves a problem. When a problem spans an organisational boundary, the potential for blurred accountability prevents effective collaboration
- when investments fail, and accountability is blurred, trust is eroded across organisational boundaries. This prevents Civil Servants from wanting to collaborate again
- different organisations have different definitions of common data attributes, meaning they can't reuse another organisation's data

#### Cost of repetition

We estimate that D% of questions government ask users are unnecessarily repeated, wasting on average E minutes per question. Users have to repeat themselves in different forms to different organisations do the thing they need to do. They also repeat themselves when switching from one channel to another to contact government. This costs government F and the public G in lost productivity. Some parts of services could be entirely removed if we already had previous answers from users. Running these services costs H per year.

#### Cost of users getting stuck

I% of support government provides is to assist users who have got stuck. Getting stuck includes:

- not knowing where to go
- going to the "wrong" place
- not knowing what is being asked of you
- not knowing what the next steps are
- not knowing the status of an application
- not getting the outcome you think you should get

This costs government J per year. Loss of productivity and reduced happiness costs the public K per year.

### Critical Success Factors

Success factors might include:

- Civil servants understand where and when services are disjointed and causes problems for users
- Users aren't repeating themselves
- Users aren't getting stuck
- Users have a smoother, more joined up experience when using government services
- Civil servants take action to address our strategic objectives (above)
- Civil servants can work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

## Key decisions that shaped this

### Sprint 0

### Sprint 1

Decision 0: We decided to test prototyping a business case throughout our Discovery

Evidence 0a: Previous discovery findings have not been followed through because of constrained funding

Decision 1: We refined research objectives to focus on disjointed services

Evidence 1a: Services being trusted is a key outcome of GOV.UK and the Digital Identity Unit. Services being responsive to user needs is a key outcome of the personalisation work on GOV.UK. There are fewer teams focusing on joining up services, so it made sense for us to focus our Discovery on this.

Decision 2: We decided to focus on the relationship between DDaT and Policy

Evidence 2a: Most other teams at GDS are focused on supporting DDaT teams across government to deliver good services. We know from [previous research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kMBxElwcKGI9MLrg_vtTgT-kTDauAEYm-3qViZADauI/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0) that most big decisions that shape services are made by policy teams. This seems like an opportunity to learn more about this.

### Sprint 2

Decision 3: We focused on ensuring that when talking about DDaT, that we're not just talking about digital.

Evidence 3a: We realised our research questions were around our specialism in digital, and didn't reflect that many other government organisations have quite a separation between technology teams and digital teams, with separate budgets and leadership.

Decision 4: We ran a session to raise our assumptions and what we already know about joined up services. This helped us focus on what we don't already know.
