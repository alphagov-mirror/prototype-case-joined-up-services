# [Prototype] Business case to help join up government services

References in brackets are the [key decisions and evidence](https://github.com/alphagov/prototype-case-joined-up-services/blob/master/key-decisions-and-evidence.md) that supports this business case.

## Executive Summary

The Government Digital Service (GDS) are setting the 2030 Vision for the Digital, Data, and Technology (DDaT) function. Within GDS, Service Design and Technology Standards are seeking funding to start working towards that vision. We want to help solve the problem of services forcing users to repeat steps across different interactions with government. This is a significant problem for a government seeking efficiency, as well as impacting the economy through lost productivity. We will use the funding to:

- improve our existing offers
- resume paused investigations
- start new investigations

This is one part of a wider problem of disjointed services, which we also intend to seek further funding to solve. This business case will therefore expand in the coming months.

## Strategic Case

### Strategic Context
 
#### What problem are we trying to solve?
 
Service Design and Technology Standards leads cross-government communities that set the bar for what good services look like. We also offer support and guidance to people using technology to improve services. We're making an initial case for investment to help deliver on the 2030 Vision for the DDaT function.

The vision says, "in 2030, government will be joined up, trusted and responsive to user needs."

We want to focus on helping government become more joined up. Currently, government services are not very joined up:

1. Users have to repeat steps. For example, to prepare to raise a child, parents tell government their due date, employer names, and household income across three separate transactions
2. Users get stuck. Government questions aren't understood by users, forms confuse users, users don't know what to do next
3. Users can't easily switch channel. Government makes users tell their story again when they switch from an online form to a call centre

All three of these problems need addressing. To start, we're prototyping a business case to address "1. Users have to repeat steps", as our research shows that this problem is far from being solved. After initial testing of this prototype, we will elaborate on the other problems (12b, 12c).

#### Why is Service Design and Technology Standards trying to solve this problem?

Other organisations struggle to make the case for change when the benefits are perceived to be realised by other government organisations or the end users of services (11b, 14a). In addition, more services are going online. It's vital for GDS to support government, from the outset, to avoid repetition for users. It's much harder to avoid once a digital service moves past the Alpha phase of development, as teams make longer-lasting technology choices.

Although it may theoretically avoid repetition for users, it wouldn't be feasible or advisable for GDS centralise the digital services of other government organisations, under a different GOV.UK architecture. As a result, GDS must start solving this common problem for government sooner rather than later. We believe Service Design and Technology Standards must take a user-centred approach to solving this problem across government, putting external and internal users at the core of this work.

We're collaborating with GOV.UK to ensure we compliment their work. We are making incremental changes to this prototype business case, informed by user research and data analysis.

#### Benefits of solving this problem

Users give the same answers to the same questions, over and over again. If we can help government to offer meaningful choices to users about reusing past answers, we will remove unnecessary questions for users. This will reduce the effort it takes to use and offer services.

In the future, this foundational work on the exchange of data could also enable government to proactively offer information and services to users in a more personalised way. This might be based around complex life events, such as having a child. These events could trigger multiple government services to meet users where they are.

There are likely other benefits that this work enables. This includes making it easier to change technology suppliers, enabling government to maximise value. It may also make it more efficient when ownership of services moves from one organisation to another.

### Strategic Objectives

Users often repeat steps along their journeys when interacting with government. This wastes time for users and public servants. Time is money.

We've observed two main causes of repetition that aren't being addressed (12):

- organisations arenâ€™t incentivised or funded to share privately-stored data about users. This leads to users repeatedly proving the same thing to government, across sequential transactions, related transactions and unrelated transactions (10, 11)
- policy teams design new and isolated schemes with limited time to understand existing services. This causes repetition for users across transactions (11)

Another key cause of repetition is users needing to identify themselves in different ways to different services. We're not looking at that, as [GOV.UK Verify](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/19/moving-forward-our-work-on-identity-assurance/) are tackling that problem.

Users have to submit evidence when using around 70% of government services (12c). Some of this evidence was originally generated by another part of government, or foreign government. Evidence often comes in the form of paper documents, such as licences, certificates, qualifications and deeds. Other times evidence comes as digital text documents or spreadsheets. Evidence can be a statement by government, such as planning permission or a judicial statement.

We think there are other causes of repetition. These include having few platforms for collaboration across organisational boundaries, and poor management of different or contradicting content which repeats along a user journey. We aim to learn more about this later in our Discovery.

#### Cost of users repeating steps

We have illustrated the cost of users repeating steps with three case studies. There are around 4000 government services, so accurately estimating the cost of the problem would be a big effort.

##### Repeating steps when preparing to raise a child

To prepare to raise a child, you would probably use three main services: 1. Plan parental leave 2. Apply for child benefits 3. Apply for child tax credits. Repeated questions include: parents full names, employers names, employers addresses, due date, annual household income, National Insurance number.

On average, the repeated questions waste A minutes for parents, and B minutes for government. Each year, this costs the economy C in lost productivity and wastes D of taxpayers' money.

If users wished to share their answers across these services, they would only need to use one service, instead of three.

##### Repeating steps when managing land

To manage land, you might use three different services: 1. Get a tree felling licence 2. Get environmental subsidies for land 3. Get a countryside maintenance grant. Repeated questions include: co-ordinates of land, soil type, land usage.

On average, the repeated questions waste A minutes for people managing land, and B minutes for government. Each year, this costs the economy C in lost productivity and wastes D of taxpayers' money.

If users wished to share their answers across these services, their applications would be much shorter.

##### Repeating steps when someone has a low income

If you have a low income, you might use three different services: 1. Apply for Universal Credit 2. Apply for free school meals 3. Apply for housing benefits. Repeated questions include: proof of income, proof of being a Universal Credit claimant.

On average, the repeated questions waste A minutes for people on low incomes, and B minutes for government. Each year, this costs the economy C in lost productivity and wastes D of taxpayers' money.

If users wished to share their answers across these services, they might only need to use one service, instead of three.

#### Key challenges for sharing privately-held data

Organisations struggle to do this because:

- different organisations value different things about the same data point. For example, an address is valuable to your local authority because it's the property you pay council tax for. To your GP, an address is valuable because it's where you want sensitive letters sent. For users and government, these addresses might be the same. In other situations, they could also be two very different things, despite both being addresses of the same person. This nuance makes it much harder to reuse another organisation's data (9a)
- there are few incentives to share data. Treasury don't allow you to claim benefits reaped by another part of government, so it is hard to make a business case for sharing your data if it doesn't benefit your organisation. The risk of data breaches still sits with your organisation, while the benefits are claimed by another (11b, 11c)
- different organisations have different availability and consistency requirements. When their requirements differ, it becomes harder to share data, and collecting the data from users again often becomes more preferable (11d)
- different organisations have different objectives, and it's hard to align them in order to collaborate (11e)
- Civil Servants are sometimes citing privacy concerns and data protection regulations as reasons to not consider sharing data. This prevents them thinking about how to best inform users and request consent for those purposes, and offer meaningful choices (13b)

#### Key challenges for policy designing schemes

Policy teams often have to write options for Ministers over short periods of time (2d). They do their best to inform their evidence base with the latest views from experts. They have limited time to work with delivery teams to understand the landscape of existing services or their effectiveness at delivering policy intent. As a result, they tend to design new schemes that repeat steps already present in existing services (13a).

Policy teams lay the foundations for government services (2b). Once legislation is passed, details of implementation can accidentally embed repetition into law. It is then much harder to remove repetition, as it becomes comparatively low priority for policy teams, but high priority for delivery teams (2c). It's therefore much more cost effective to influence policy early on.

### Critical Success Factors

Success factors might include:

- Users aren't repeating themselves
- Civil servants take action to address our strategic objectives (above)
- Civil servants can work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users and to deliver on policy intent

### Benefits

To be written.

## Economic Case

### Options

To be written, with the support of an options framework table.

#### How might we

Before we develop options, we've written some how might we questions to return to later.

How might we incentivise government organisations to share privately-held data to reduce repetition for users, and remove the need for some services?

How might we help policy teams understand the effectiveness of current services at delivering on policy intent?
