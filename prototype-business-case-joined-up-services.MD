# [Prototype] Business case to help join up government services

## Strategic Case

### Strategic Context

We aim to provide an initial case for investment to help Service Design and Technology standards deliver on the 2030 Vision for the DDaT function.

The vision says, "in 2030, government services will be joined up, trusted and responsive to user needs." GDS will help the DDaT function deliver on the promises in the vision. GDS Service Design and Technology Standards sets the bar for what good services look like. We want to provide better support for government to meet those standards.

This case for investment aims to compliment work on GOV.UK. We will make incremental changes to this prototype business case, informed by user research and data analysis.

### Strategic Objectives

Services are disjointed when:

- Users are unable to do the thing they need to do with government without repetition or getting stuck
- Users cannot switch between channels without repetition
- Government is unable to work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

These things cost money. The cost to users means people are less productive, less happy, and less likely to trust government. 

### Critical Success Factors

Success factors might include:

- Civil servants understand where and when services are disjointed and causes problems for users
- Users aren't repeating themselves
- Users aren't getting stuck
- Users have a smoother, more joined up experience when using government services
- Civil servants take action to address our strategic objectives (above)
- Civil servants can work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

## Key decisions that shaped this

### Sprint 0

### Sprint 1

Decision 0: We decided to test prototyping a business case throughout our Discovery

Evidence 0a: Previous discovery findings have not been followed through because of constrained funding

Decision 1: We refined research objectives to focus on disjointed services

Evidence 1a: Services being trusted is a key outcome of GOV.UK and the Digital Identity Unit. Services being responsive to user needs is a key outcome of the personalisation work on GOV.UK. There are fewer teams focusing on joining up services, so it made sense for us to focus our Discovery on this.

Decision 2: We decided to focus on the relationship between DDaT and Policy

Evidence 2a: Most other teams at GDS are focused on supporting DDaT teams across government to deliver good services. We know from [previous research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kMBxElwcKGI9MLrg_vtTgT-kTDauAEYm-3qViZADauI/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0) that most big decisions that shape services are made by policy teams. This seems like an opportunity to learn more about this.

### Sprint 2

Decision 3: We focused on ensuring that when talking about DDaT, that we're not just talking about digital.

Evidence 3a: We realised our research questions were around our specialism in digital, and didn't reflect that many other government organisations have quite a separation between technology teams and digital teams, with separate budgets and leadership.

Decision 4: We ran a session to raise our assumptions and what we already know about joined up services. This helped us focus on what we don't already know.

### Sprint 3

Decision 5: We developed a research plan that highlighted our approach to addressing our OKRs. This included a start to identifying who accross Government could help us answer our key questions, and how we might associate costs to the challenges we hear about.

Decision 6: We began to identify and contact people across Government who might help us address our key questions, initially concentrating on internal GDS people who have experience in Tech, Data, Policy and working accross Government.

Evidence 6a: We realised that we only have a short period of time to run our research and internal GDS people would be avaulable at short notice (external, x-gov people are being contacted now for interviews over the next few weeks). We're focussing on Data, TEch and Policy because we ackowledge that's where our team blind-spots are. Our aim over the 4 weeks is to cover as many different stakeholder groups as possible, but also covering big depts with and without Policy Labs, and smaller depts.

Decision 7: We developed a strategy for identifying costs and a plan to associate these against the challenges to joined up working we see in our research. We acklowledged that our questions wouldn't focus on identifying indicators for disjoint, but more to uncover the narrative behind what challenges there are, what these look like (examples) potential ways that these may be overcome. 

Evidence 7a: We think there is agreement already about that fact that Government services are disjointed, therefore our efforts should be about telling that narrative and what impact they have on people, users, Government and society. Costs can then be assigned to that state of play and impact narrative.

Decisions 7: Giving people the tools and standards will not be enough to change the way civil servants  work.

Evidence 7a: Adoption of the standard is the hard bit. Some people do not want to adopt them or do not have the ability


Decision 8: Legacy IT and operation are barriers to joining up services and is one of the hard problems to solve.

Evidence 8a: Government has made the front end of services better but it is still a mess behind the scenes and we need to change the way we do things. That back end is legacy shaped by operations back in the days.

Decision 9: Business approaches mental models on what is important for some organisations are different to another organisation even if they dealing with the same users.

Evidence 9a: HMRC see a person who has income and pay tax and home office see someone crossing the border.

Decision 10: Barrier for x-government collaboration is lack of trust in others data. 

Evidence 10a: It might not be worth collecting someone else's data when you canâ€™t trust it. The other department that needs it chooses to ask users again to make sure the data is correct and up to date. By standardising what data is used and how to keep it updated it can remove some of  these tech barriers and lead to collaboration. Standardise ways of doing things to make it easier to collaborate because sharing becomes easier

Decision 11: Incentives people to collaborate.

Evidence 11a: Currently we see it with treasure having a pot of money for cross boundaries projects and cabinet office strategic framework.  Other potentially ways could be by applying a standard to unify the way things are done.


Decision 12: To avoid legacy system focus on the right set-up for maintaining a service and get senior leaders investing in maintaining a service  

Evidence 12a: Teams move on and when a service breaks the knowledge they had is lost and it might be easier to rebuild the service rather than finding out how to fix it. 

Decision 13: The team needs to create an appealing story to get senior decision makers engaged and ensure the idea lands well.

Evidence 13a: Difficult to engage people talking about the route cause of data issue (metadata) when they just want to hear about the first step of what data to capture  rather than thinking ahead. Focus more on security risk than transformational barriers because it cause more engagement
