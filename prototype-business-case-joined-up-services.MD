# [Prototype] Business case to help join up government services

## Strategic Case

### Strategic Context

We aim to provide an initial case for investment to help Service Design and Technology standards deliver on the 2030 Vision for the DDaT function. The vision says in 2030 Government services will be joined up, trusted and responsive to user needs. GDS' role is help transform Government to deliver on this vision by setting the satndards for services. 

GDS Service Design and Technology Standards sets the bar for what good services look like. We want to provide better support for Government to meet those standards.

This work aims to compliment work on GOV.UK. We will achieve this through user research, and delivering incremental changes to a prototype business case.

### Strategic Objectives

Services are disjointed when:

- Users are unable to do the thing they need to do with government without repetition or getting stuck
- Users cannot switch between channels without repetition
- Government is unable to work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

These things cost money, and the cost to users means people are less productive, less happy and are less likely to trust Government. 

### Critical Success Factors

Success factors might include:

- Civil servants understand where and when services are disjointed and causes problems for users
- Users have a smoother, more joined up experience when using Government services
- Civil servants take action to address our strategic objectives (above)

Decision 2: We decided to focus on the relationship between DDAT and Policy

### Sprint 2

Decision 3: We focussed on ensuring that when talking about DDAT, that we're not just talking about digital.

Decision 4: We ran a session to raise our assumptions and what we already know about joined up services.
