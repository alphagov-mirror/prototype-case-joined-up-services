# [Prototype] Business case to help join up government services

## Strategic Case

### Strategic Context

We aim to provide an initial case for investment to help Service Design and Technology standards deliver on the 2030 Vision for the DDaT function.

The vision says, "in 2030, government services will be joined up, trusted and responsive to user needs." GDS will help the DDaT function deliver on the promises in the vision. GDS Service Design and Technology Standards sets the bar for what good services look like. We want to provide better support for government to meet those standards.

This case for investment aims to compliment work on GOV.UK. We will make incremental changes to this prototype business case, informed by user research and data analysis.

### Strategic Objectives

Services are disjointed when:

- Users are unable to do the thing they need to do with government without repetition or getting stuck
- Users cannot switch between channels without repetition
- Government is unable to work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

These things cost money. The cost to users means people are less productive, less happy, and less likely to trust government. 

### Critical Success Factors

Success factors might include:

- Civil servants understand where and when services are disjointed and causes problems for users
- Users aren't repeating themselves
- Users aren't getting stuck
- Users have a smoother, more joined up experience when using government services
- Civil servants take action to address our strategic objectives (above)
- Civil servants can work across organisational boundaries towards outcomes for users

## Key decisions that shaped this

### Sprint 0

### Sprint 1

Decision 0: We decided to test prototyping a business case throughout our Discovery

Evidence 0a: Previous discovery findings have not been followed through because of constrained funding

Decision 1: We refined research objectives to focus on disjointed services

Evidence 1a: Services being trusted is a key outcome of GOV.UK and the Digital Identity Unit. Services being responsive to user needs is a key outcome of the personalisation work on GOV.UK. There are fewer teams focusing on joining up services, so it made sense for us to focus our Discovery on this.

Decision 2: We decided to focus on the relationship between DDaT and Policy

Evidence 2a: Most other teams at GDS are focused on supporting DDaT teams across government to deliver good services. We know from [previous research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kMBxElwcKGI9MLrg_vtTgT-kTDauAEYm-3qViZADauI/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0) that most big decisions that shape services are made by policy teams. This seems like an opportunity to learn more about this.

### Sprint 2

Decision 3: We focused on ensuring that when talking about DDaT, that we're not just talking about digital.

Evidence 3a: We realised our research questions were around our specialism in digital, and didn't reflect that many other government organisations have quite a separation between technology teams and digital teams, with separate budgets and leadership.

Decision 4: We ran a session to raise our assumptions and what we already know about joined up services. This helped us focus on what we don't already know.

Decisions: Giving people the tools and standards will not be enough to change them

Evidence: P2… Adoption of the standard is the hard bit, want to or not having the ability


Barrier to collaboration
01
legacy IT and operation decision has affected the services. 

Evidence: we have change the front end of services but it is still a mess behind the scene and we need to change the way we do things which is legacy shaped by operations back in the days.

02
Business approach mental model on what is important for some organisations are different to another organisation even if they dealing with the same users

Evidence: HMRC see a person who has income and pay tax and home office see someone crossing the border

03
Lack of trust in other peoples work. Removing these tech barriers would lead to cross departmental services by standardise what data is used and how to keep it updated

Evidence: It then might not be worth collecting someone else's data when you can’t trust it. You then ask users again.

04
Enablers for collaboration
Incentives people to collaborate by forcing a standard or provide funding for the initiatives we want

Evidence: treasure provide funding for cross boundaries projects

05
Focus on the right set-up for maintaining a service and get senior leaders to care about it. E.g, Live reviews

Evidence: Teams move on and when a service breaks the knowledge they had is lost and it might be easier to rebuild the service rather than finding out how to fix it. 


06
You need to create an appealing storyline to get people engaged and land the idea

Evidence: Difficult to engage people talking about the route cause of data issue when they just want to hear about the first step of capturing data rather than thinking ahead. Focus more on security risk than transformational barriers because it cause more engagement

07-08
Standardise ways of doing things to make it easier to collaborate because sharing becomes esier

Evidence P2…

Create a movement with more like minded will create a snowball effect so more people join
