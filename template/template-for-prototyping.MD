# Template for prototyping a case for change

## Strategic Case

Write this first, as we'll base the Economic Case on this.

### Strategic Context

- Why are we conducting this project?
- How does it align to wider government objectives?

### Strategic Objectives

- What are the key challenges we are trying to overcome?

### Critical Success Factors

- What will need to observe in order to say that these challenges have been addressed?
- What are the key dependencies for success in this project?

### Benefits

- If we address the challenges that we have identified, what costs could we overcome or what benefits could we unlock?

## Economic Case

### Options

Here's an [example of an Options Framework Table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtwEhUiVRJ_RzkWbNNajlRIW7zfklZqs-IhTg5gwoN4/edit), showing the method we will use to come up with options.

- Given the challenges and benefits that we have identified, what are the possible options available for addressing these challenges?
- Which benefits would each of these options unlock?

## Key decisions that shaped this

When describing a challenge we're trying to overcome or an option for addressing it, reference the relevant decisions or where we learnt about it. Here's an example:

> People don't always feel like they are part of a team, so we're going to have a partner network of curry houses for newly-formed teams in the Civil Service (1a).

When writing what evidence informed the decision, link off to other documents for further reading. This would include user research findings or analysis of data.

### Sprint 0

Decision 1: We decided to go for a team curry.

Evidence 1a: “Teams that eat curry together are a sign of a great team” [P2](https://www.morningfuture.com/en/article/2018/03/23/social-eating-team-building/260/)
