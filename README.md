# [Prototype] Case for helping join up government services

## Introduction

A team at the Government Digital Service are prototyping a concise case for helping join up government services. We're publishing changes each week during our [Discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works), which runs from February to March 2020. We will update this prototype, as we learn more about the cost of disjointed government services, their impact on users and government.

### What is this prototype?

This is an early prototype of our team's case for change, which we are making to sponsors at the Government Digital Service. This isn't a case that HM Treasury would review, but if we're successful in gathering the support of our sponsors, this might inform a future business case.

Weâ€™re writing a strategic narrative. This outlines what the core issues are, why they exist, and what might be done to address them. We aim to give examples of these issues where possible, to help inform our future proposals.

Any figures given to support the case are just initial estimates, and need further work to ensure they are robust. There will be mistakes, and inaccuracies. Please tell us, and we'll do our best to improve it.

### Why are we sharing this?

We hope by [making this open, we will make it better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better).

While we are doing our best to learn about users and their needs, both inside and outside government, the size of this problem space means we will have gaps. We need your feedback to help us take this from a prototype to an effective case for helping join up government services. You can give us feedback by raising an issue, or opening a pull request. You can also DM [@vosageroll](https://twitter.com/vosageroll) on Twitter.

We hope by referencing key decisions, and the evidence behind them, that you'll see how we reached the conclusions. The evidence comes from ongoing user research interviews and data analysis, as well as previous Discoveries.
