# Key decisions that shaped our prototype business case

## Sprint 0

## Sprint 1

### Decision 0

We decided to test prototyping a business case throughout our Discovery

Evidence 0a: Previous discovery findings have not been followed through because of constrained funding

### Decision 1

We refined research objectives to focus on disjointed services

Evidence 1a: Services being trusted is a key outcome of GOV.UK and the Digital Identity Unit. Services being responsive to user needs is a key outcome of the personalisation work on GOV.UK. There are fewer teams focusing on joining up services, so it made sense for us to focus our Discovery on this.

### Decision 2

We decided to focus on the relationship between Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) and Policy

Evidence 2a: Most other teams at the Government Digital Service (GDS) are focused on supporting DDaT teams across government to deliver good services. We know from previous research that most [big decisions that shape services are made by policy teams]((https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kMBxElwcKGI9MLrg_vtTgT-kTDauAEYm-3qViZADauI/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0)). This seems like an opportunity to learn more about this.

Evidence 2b: 80% of power is still in policy when it comes to designing and delivering services. [Policy stakeholders often hold the strongest veto power](https://trello.com/b/zLjzJBwZ/q1-policy-delivery-ops-research).

Evidence 2c: Service teams often have no way to [escalate an issue when it comes to policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kw9EIGIQIhMMwOsQbEJFwh11i08oXPd_CtZGPrPbjeM/edit).

Evidence 2d: [Ministers reign](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qLnlurfk7u7M_P0MMguCACjxJaRbD7F5OLBlruVQO58/edit#slide=id.p), policy driven decisions and operation teams have agendas.

## Sprint 2

### Decision 3

We focused on ensuring that when talking about DDaT, that we're not just talking about digital.

Evidence 3a: We realised our research questions were around our specialism in digital, and didn't reflect that many other government organisations have quite a separation between technology teams and digital teams, with separate budgets and leadership.

### Decision 4

We ran a session to raise our assumptions and what we already know about joined up services. This helped us focus on what we don't already know.

## Sprint 3

### Decision 5

We developed a research plan that highlighted our approach to addressing our objectives and key results. This included a start to identifying who across government could help us answer our key questions, and how we might associate costs to the challenges we hear about.

### Decision 6

We began to identify and contact people across government who might help us address our key questions, initially concentrating on internal GDS people who have experience in technology, data, policy and working across government.

Evidence 6a: We realised that we only have a short period of time to run our research and internal GDS people would be available at short notice. External people across government are being contacted now for interviews over the next few weeks. We're focusing on data, technology and policy because we acknowledge that's where our team blind-spots are. Our aim over the four weeks is to cover as many different stakeholder groups as possible, but also covering big departments with and without Policy Labs, as well as smaller departments.

### Decision 7

We developed a strategy for identifying costs and a plan to associate these against the challenges to joined up working we see in our research. We acknowledged that our questions wouldn't focus on identifying indicators of disjointedness, but more to uncover the narrative behind what challenges there are, what these look like, and potential ways that these may be overcome.

Evidence 7a: We think there is agreement already about that fact that government services are disjointed, therefore our efforts should be about telling that narrative and what impact they have on people, users, government and society. Costs can then be assigned to that state of play and impact narrative.

### Decision 8

We will put definitions inline in the prototype business case.

Evidence 8a: We realise definitions are important to be able to be specific about what problems we are solving. If the inline definitions start to get in the way of readability, we will add them as an annex.

### Decision 9

We recognise that organisations have different mental models of what is important to them, even if they are dealing with the same users.

Evidence 9a: "HMRC see a person who has income and pays tax. Home Office see someone crossing the border." P?

### Decision 10

Trust is necessary to use others data and collaborate.

Evidence 10a: "It then might not be worth collecting someone else's data when you can’t trust it. You then ask users again. By standardising what data is used and how to keep it updated, it can remove some of these tech barriers and lead to collaboration. Standardise ways of doing things to make it easier to collaborate because sharing becomes easier." P?

Evidence 10b: "Policy people have been burnt by delivery a couple of times. I think there were legacy systems involved. As they built the new service, things didn’t work as expected. Letters weren’t being sent when they should have. They created a comms headache." P?

### Decision 11

People need incentives to collaborate.

Evidence 11a: Treasury have the Shared Outcomes Fund – a pot of money for cross-boundaries projects and Cabinet Office have the Strategic Framework. Other incentives could be through applying a standard to unify the way things are done.

Evidence 11b: "Everything from Treasury looks at one project. You don’t get rewarded if your service helps a different service." P?

Evidence 11c: Disjointed services caused by the [government funding model are not set up for cross boundary collaboration](https://trello.com/b/zLjzJBwZ/q1-policy-delivery-ops-research) and delivery of end to end services.

Evidence 11d: Logistic problems getting in the way of collaboration such as [people not using the same tech](https://trello.com/b/zLjzJBwZ/q1-policy-delivery-ops-research).

Evidence 11e: [Government structure stands in the way of collaboration](https://trello.com/b/zLjzJBwZ/q1-policy-delivery-ops-research). For example: policy teams under different directors, operations sitting separately, teams in different locations, and an end to end service spanning across organisations. Aligning these organisational objectives is hard.

## Sprint 4

### Decision 12

We will focus this prototype business case on users repeating themselves, which is one aspect of 'joined up'.

Evidence 12a: Our current team is only together until 27th March 2020. It's better to have tested a smaller prototype and learn something, than to get a third through building a larger prototype and learn nothing.

Evidence 12b: Users have less expectation to be able to seamlessly switch channel, as this isn't something they can do well in the private sector. GDS is further away from solving repetition for users. Through the GOV.UK Design System, the Service Standard, user-centred Communities of Practice and Service Assessments, GDS has made good progress on reducing the amount of times users get stuck.

Evidence 12c: Users have to submit proof when using around 70% of government services. Some of this proof was originally generated by another part of government. This was found during the [GOV.UK Submit Alpha](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0IYCICf5zhJGJP6Rk_bU3p9f-SxRsCF/view).

## Sprint 5

### Decision 13

We think there are two key causes of users repeating themselves. Organisations aren’t incentivised or funded to share privately-stored data about users. Policy teams design new and isolated schemes with limited time to understand existing services.

Evidence 10a: See above

Evidence 13a: [Policy and design research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kWFiLE6QjkmBg4soH0QiyKwDUSIm4Zzu5mUq3ftCQAg/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0)

### Decision 14

GDS are best placed to help solve the problem of users repeating steps along user journeys.

Evidence 14a: While user needs are important to departments, [it’s often not possible to make change happen unless there is a clear benefit to the business](https://drive.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/file/d/1n0IYCICf5zhJGJP6Rk_bU3p9f-SxRsCF/view?usp=sharing) e.g. reducing the processing times, running the service more efficiently, reducing the number of calls to customers service etc.
